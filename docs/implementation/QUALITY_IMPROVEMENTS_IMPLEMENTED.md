## 🎉 COMPLETED: Fade Transitions

**Status:** ✅ Implemented  
**Impact:** Medium-High  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Time:** Completed

### **What Was Changed:**
- ✅ Added smooth fade-in/fade-out transitions between images
- ✅ 0.5 second crossfade for professional look
- ✅ Overlapping fades create seamless transitions

### **Code Location:**
- File: `departments/production/simple_render_engine.py`
- Lines: ~273-300
- Function: `render_horror_video()`

### **How It Works:**
1. Each image clip fades in over 0.5 seconds
2. Stays at full opacity during main duration
3. Fades out over 0.5 seconds (overlaps with next image)
4. Creates smooth crossfade effect

### **Expected Impact:**
- ✅ More polished, professional look
- ✅ Smoother visual flow
- ✅ Better viewer experience
- ✅ Reduced "jarring" cuts
