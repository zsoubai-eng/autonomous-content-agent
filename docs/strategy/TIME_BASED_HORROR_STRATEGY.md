## 📅 PUBLISHING WINDOWS (4 Per Day)

### **Morning Horror (6:00 AM - 11:00 AM EST)**
**Optimal Time:** 7:30 AM EST (Morning Commute)

**Viewer State:**
- Awake, alert, logical
- Low anxiety, higher energy
- Analytical mindset

**Content Type:** Mild, clever, slightly unsettling
**Goal:** Curiosity + subtle tension (not heart attacks)

**Horror Types:**
1. **Psychological Horror** - Small twist, "what if this is happening?"
   - Example: Character notices subtle changes in house after waking up
2. **Existential Horror** - Concept-based, thought-provoking
   - Example: "If you slept for a year, what if the world moved on?"
3. **Background Horror** - Hidden details in ordinary places
   - Example: Quiet office scene with figure subtly in background

**Why:** Morning brains are analytical; they enjoy clever, thought-provoking unease

### **Afternoon Horror (12:00 PM - 5:00 PM EST)**
**Optimal Time:** 2:00 PM EST (Lunch Break)

**Viewer State:**
- Moderate energy, slightly distracted
- More social, multitasking
- Need quick engagement

**Content Type:** Light suspense, humor-tinged, mild jump scares
**Goal:** Grab attention in short bursts without discomfort

**Horror Types:**
1. **Suspense / Anticipatory Horror** - Quick build-up, short release
   - Example: Lights flicker behind someone walking down hallway
2. **Minimalist Horror** - Subtle weirdness, small glitch
   - Example: Coffee cup moves by itself for a second
3. **Human Threat / Stalker Horror** - Relatable fear, low gore
   - Example: "Someone is watching your live feed"

**Why:** Afternoon viewers want quick, snackable fear that doesn't interrupt their day

---

### **Evening Horror (6:00 PM - 9:00 PM EST)**
**Optimal Time:** 8:00 PM EST (Horror Peak ⭐)

**Viewer State:**
- More relaxed, low energy
- Open to immersive experiences
- Ready for deeper engagement

**Content Type:** Moderate tension, supernatural hints, immersive
**Goal:** Pull them into a story without exhausting them

**Horror Types:**
1. **Supernatural / Paranormal Horror** - Ghosts, entities, flickering lights
   - Example: Mirror shows figure that isn't there when turning back
2. **POV Horror** - Immersive, relatable situations
   - Example: POV walking into dark hallway with whispering
3. **Psychological Horror** - Deeper twists
   - Example: "You're not alone... and they know your secrets"

**Why:** Viewers are more open to slower, creepier tension; jump scares are okay but occasional

---

### **Night Horror (10:00 PM - 5:00 AM EST)**
**Optimal Time:** 10:30 PM EST (Night Horror)

**Viewer State:**
- Low energy, heightened imagination
- More emotional, vulnerable
- Lower logic, higher fear response

**Content Type:** Intense horror, unresolved tension, fear of the unknown
**Goal:** Exploit imagination; leave lingering unease

**Horror Types:**
1. **Supernatural / Paranormal Horror** - Ghosts, shadows, unexplained noises
2. **Psychological Horror** - Existential dread, subtle paranoia
3. **Background Horror / Hidden Detail** - Subtle, terrifying details
4. **Found Footage Horror** - Realism increases fear at night

**Example:**
- POV in dark room, breathing sounds, shadow moves, text: "It's closer than you think", cut to black

**Why:** Nighttime viewers have amplified imagination and lowered logic; unresolved scares create rewatches

## 🎯 IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### **Content Generation Rules:**
1. **Time-Based Story Selection** - Match story type to publishing window
2. **Intensity Scaling** - Morning (mild) → Night (intense)
3. **Psychological Matching** - Content matches viewer state
4. **Consistent Publishing** - 4 videos/day = 4x algorithm checks

### **Expected Benefits:**
- **Higher Engagement:** Content matches viewer psychology
- **More Algorithm Checks:** 4x daily publishing = more distribution
- **Reduced Fatigue:** Variety prevents viewer burnout
- **Better Retention:** Right content at right time = longer watch time
