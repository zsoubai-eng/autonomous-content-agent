## 🎯 What This Means for Your Videos

### ✅ **Good News:**
- **Scheduled uploads should still work** - Videos will be uploaded and scheduled
- **Processing delays** - Videos may just take longer to become available after scheduled time
- **Analytics delays** - Your view counts/data may be delayed, but videos are still being watched

### ⚠️ **Potential Issues:**
1. **Scheduled videos might not publish exactly on time** - Could be delayed by a few minutes/hours
2. **Analytics won't be accurate immediately** - Wait 24-48 hours for accurate data
3. **Video processing** - Thumbnails/quality might take longer to finalize

## 🔍 What to Check

1. **YouTube Studio → Scheduled Videos:**
   - Check if your scheduled videos are still there
   - They should still publish, just might be delayed

2. **Video Status:**
   - Videos might show "Processing" longer than usual
   - This is normal during this issue

3. **Analytics:**
   - Don't rely on immediate analytics data
   - Wait 24-48 hours for accurate numbers
