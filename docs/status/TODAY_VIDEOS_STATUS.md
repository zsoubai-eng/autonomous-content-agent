## ⚠️ ISSUE IDENTIFIED

**Problem:** Videos were generated at 3:50 PM EST, which is AFTER the first two scheduled times (7:30 AM and 2:00 PM).

**What happened:**
- YouTube may have published videos 1 & 2 immediately (since scheduled time was in the past)
- OR YouTube may have scheduled them for tomorrow at the same times
- Videos 3 & 4 should be properly scheduled for 8:00 PM and 10:30 PM today

---

## 💡 RECOMMENDATION

**For future runs:**
- Generate videos EARLY in the day (before 7:30 AM) to ensure all scheduled times are in the future
- OR schedule videos for TOMORROW's windows instead of today's if generation happens late

**To check current status:**
1. Open YouTube Studio
2. Search for video IDs: `9RTXHRgUFAk`, `mK36wSK8oH0`, `3gbmdjrBdTw`, `EQ47HJo9etg`
3. Check their publish status and scheduled times
